# Sentiment Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model that classifies customer reviews as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is designed to analyze the sentiment of textual data, such as customer reviews, to assist businesses in gaining insights into customer satisfaction.

# Key Features
- Sentiment Classification: The model categorizes reviews into two classes: positive and negative.
- Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and prepared through tokenization, removing stopwords, and feature extraction.
- **Model Performance**: The model achieves an accuracy of **85%**.

# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: 
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and tokenization
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for model development and evaluation

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer reviews from various products or services, each labeled as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

# Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Saumyass28/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Preprocess the Data**  
   The script will preprocess the text data by:
   - Removing punctuation
   - Tokenizing the text
   - Removing stopwords
   - Performing lemmatization

4. **Train the Model**  
   Run the following command to train the model:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   After training, evaluate the model using the test data:
   ```
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. An 85% accuracy was achieved on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model by experimenting with different feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF.
- Integrating additional machine learning models to improve accuracy.
- Deploying the model as a web service using Flask or a similar framework.
